The first part is to create your Virtaul Machine, which I used Microsoft Azure as my system. Once the Virtual Machine is created, next is to Remote Desktop into your Virtual Machine.

Once you've remoted into your Virtual Machine, it's time to set the parameters and upload your downloads to your system. There are a lot of uploads that take place. Once such upload needed for your system is Information Internet Services. This is a way for the transfer of information using web servers.

After the perimeters have been met and all the uploads have taken place, the osTicket system wil be executable on your Virtual Machine created. You will need to create an username and password as being an administrator.

Once logged in, this will be the basis/home screen of the osTicketing system. Rules, perimeters, who can be granted access to execute certain functions, service level aggreements, and etc. will be made from this beginning screen in the osTicketing system.

Agents and Administrators have two different pages where rules and perimeters can be selected for each seperate functions. Admins can select their screen to set who can execute certain functions for the agents. Admins will  provide the basis for the administrators. Agents will be able to select their screen. From their side, they will be able set Service Level Agreements to have come up with a solution for the client's issues.

<p>
Service Level Agreements are the basis for solving ticket issues. They will be the guidelines for having issues resolved in a timely manner. Different agreements will have diffent levels of authority and may require more of timmely solution.
